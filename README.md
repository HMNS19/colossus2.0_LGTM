# GreenGrids: Urban Heat Mapping & Green Intervention Tool

GreenGrids is a data-driven web application for mapping urban heat islands and recommending strategic green interventions to improve urban livability.

## 🌱 About

GreenGrids helps urban planners, environmental scientists, and city officials visualize heat patterns in urban areas, identify hotspots, and implement evidence-based greening strategies to mitigate the urban heat island effect. By mapping temperature, air quality, and vegetation data, we provide actionable insights for creating cooler, more livable cities.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Heat Maps**: Visualize urban heat islands and temperature variations across different city areas
- **Livability Index**: Score and rank urban areas based on temperature, air quality, and vegetation metrics
- **Urban Cooling Simulator**: Calculate the impact of tree planting on temperature reduction and CO₂ sequestration
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Get targeted suggestions for strategic urban greening interventions
- **Historical Analysis**: Compare environmental data across different years to track changes

## 🚀 Getting Started
